    "Classification is a problem of assigning a label to an **unlabeled example**. In machine learning, the classification problem is solved by a classification learning algorithm that takes **a collection of labeled examples** as inputs and produces a model that can take an unlabeled example as input and either directly **output a label or output a number** that can be used by the data analyst to deduce the label easily.\n",

    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the dataset is the collection of labeled examples $\\{(X_i , y_i)\\}^N_{i=1}$. Each element $x_i$ among $N$ is called a **feature vector**. A feature vector is a vector in which each dimension $j = 1, \\dots, D$ contains a value that describes the example. That value is called a feature and is denoted as $x^j$ . The label $y_i$ can be either an element belonging to a finite set of classes ${1, 2, \\dots, C}$, or a real number, or a more complex structure, like a vector, a matrix, a tree, or a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to use the dataset to produce a model that takes a feature vector $X_i$ as input and outputs information that allows deducing the label for this feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **unsupervised learning**, the dataset is a collection of unlabeled examples $\\{(X_i)\\}^N_{i=1}$. Again, $X_i$ is a feature vector, and the goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to create a model that takes a feature vector $X_i$ as input and either transforms it into another vector or into a value that can be used to solve a practical problem.\n",
